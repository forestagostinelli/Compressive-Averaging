---------REPLICATING RESULTS---------
To replicate the results in figures 4a run
>> test_gunlaw_sparse

To replicate the results in figure 4b run
>> test_fework_sparse

We have not yet been given permission to distribute the data for the Xbox dataset for the 2012 presidenial election.

---------GENERAL USE---------
Right now, the code is only for binary data.

The script experiment/test_general.m contains a shell for with users can run their own experiments.
Right now it uses the gunlaw dataset and plots the adjusted means. To see the results run
>> test_general

The user can run it on their own data by replacing the 'samples' variable.

The samples variable is a cell. Each element in the cell represents a timepoint.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure that samples is a Tx1 cell (T is the number of timepoints) 
and each element in the cell is a double 1xN vector (where N is the number of samples)
in which each entry in the vector is either a 1 or a 2.

The default method is orthogonal matching pursuit. However, one can switch to the deep neural network method
by switchig the 'type' variable to 'DNN'. The deep neural network takes a few hours to train.
